About Me
Hi, I’m Shaon, a 2nd-year undergraduate student at the Institute of Information Technology (IIT), Jahangirnagar University (JU).

I am highly passionate about creating new and meaningful software projects. I have already worked on several projects, including:

UniFix – A platform designed to solve various university-related issues

Student Attendance System – A system built to manage and track student attendance efficiently

I have also completed several frontend projects that are practical, regularly usable, and aim to solve real-life problems

I have a strong interest in web development. I’ve completed my work on the frontend, and now I am actively trying to learn and build projects using backend technologies.

Alongside development, I am also focusing on problem solving and competitive programming, working to improve my skills in data structures and algorithms. I am trying to maintain a balance between both programming and development.

At the same time, I stay focused on my academic studies, aiming to build a strong foundation in computer science.
